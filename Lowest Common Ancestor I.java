/*
Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor.

Assumptions
There is no parent pointer for the nodes in the binary tree
The given two nodes are guaranteed to be in the binary tree

Examples

        5

      /   \

     9     12

   /  \      \

  2    3      14

The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 14 is 5
The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 9 is 9

time = O(n)
space = O(height) = O(n)
